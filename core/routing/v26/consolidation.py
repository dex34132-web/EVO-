"""Session/experience consolidation for Lerev V2.6.

Consolidation processes episodic experiences into more durable forms,
potentially promoting them to learned knowledge.

Design principles:
- Deterministic: same inputs → same outputs
- Scope-safe: never mix scopes during consolidation
- Provenance-preserving: original experience IDs retained
- Bounded: processing time proportional to input size
- Idempotent: safe to re-run on same inputs
